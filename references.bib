   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of death or tracheostomy placement (D/T) in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD) born < 32 weeks' gestation referred to regional neonatal intensive care units. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in infants born < 32 weeks' gestation with sBPD in 2010-2011, using the Children's Hospital Neonatal Database. sBPD was defined as the need for FiO2 ⩾ 0.3, nasal cannula support >2 l min(-1) or positive pressure at 36 weeks' post menstrual age. The primary outcome was D/T before discharge. Predictors associated with D/T in bivariable analyses (P < 0.2) were used to develop a multivariable logistic regression equation using 80% of the cohort. This equation was validated in the remaining 20% of infants. RESULT: Of 793 eligible patients, the mean gestational age was 26 weeks' and the median age at referral was 6.4 weeks. D/T occurred in 20% of infants. Multivariable analysis showed that later gestational age at birth, later age at referral along with pulmonary management as the primary reason for referral, mechanical ventilation at the time of referral, clinically diagnosed pulmonary hypertension, systemic corticosteroids after referral and occurrence of a bloodstream infection after referral were each associated with D/T. The model performed well with validation (area under curve 0.86, goodness-of-fit χ(2), P = 0.66). CONCLUSION: Seven clinical variables predicted D/T in this large, contemporary cohort with sBPD. These results can be used to inform clinicians who counsel families of affected infants and to assist in the design of future prospective trials.},

   abstract = {Social isolation might be considered as a marker of poor health and higher mortality. The aim of our analysis was to assess the association of social network index (SNI) with incident AF and death. We selected participants aged ≥ 55 years without prevalent AF from the Framingham Heart Study. We evaluated the association between social isolation measured by the Berkman-Syme Social Network Index (SNI), incident AF, and mortality without diagnosed AF. We assessed the risk factor-adjusted associations between SNI (the sum of 4 components: marriage status, close friends/relatives, religious service attendance, social group participation), incident AF, and mortality without AF by using Fine-Gray competing risk regression models. We secondarily examined the outcome of all-cause mortality. We included 3454 participants (mean age 67 ± 10 years, 58% female). During 11.8 ± 5.2 mean years of follow-up, there were 686 incident AF cases and 965 mortality without AF events. Individuals with fewer connections had lower rates of incident AF (P = 0.04) but higher rates of mortality without AF (P = 0.03). Among SNI components, only social group participation was associated with higher incident AF (subdistribution hazards ratio [sHR] 1.35, 95% CI 1.16-1.57, P = 0.0001). For mortality without AF, social group participation (sHR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.71-0.93, P = 0.002) and regular religious service attendance sHR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.87, P < 0.0001) were associated with lower risk of death. Social isolation was associated with a higher rate of mortality without diagnosed AF. In contrast to our hypothesis, we observed that poor social connectedness was associated with a lower rate of incident AF. This finding should be interpreted cautiously since there were very few participants in the lowest social connectedness group. Additionally, the seemingly protective effect of social isolation on AF incidence may be simply an artifact of the strong association between social isolation and increased mortality rate in combination with the large number of deaths as compared to AF events in our study. Further study is warranted.},
